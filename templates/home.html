        <h5>How does PostGold work?</h5>
        <p>PostGold relies on something called Markov Chains to
            generate its outputs. A Markov chain is a mathematical system that experiences transitions from one state to
            another according to certain probabilistic rules. The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is that no
            matter how the process arrived at its present state, the possible future states are fixed. In other words,
            the probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the current state <a

            In short, given a certain word, our algorithm makes probabilistic decisions
            based on training data to determine what word comes next. Interate this process,
            and you have an output!
