## Welcome to PostGold!!
PostGold is a predictive text generator.

How does PostGold work?
PostGold relies on something called Markov Chains to generate its outputs. A Markov chain is a mathematical system that experiences transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is that no matter how the process arrived at its present state, the possible future states are fixed. In other words, the probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the current state. In short, given a certain word, our algorithm makes probabilistic decisions based on training data to determine what word comes next. Interate this process, and you have an output!
